# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure("punycoder")` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and
# audits punycoder's declared dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It
# is a network test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER /
# OSSINDEX_TOKEN):
# the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401, so the test is
# guarded to skip wherever those preconditions are absent (CRAN, offline,
# missing credentials, oysteR not installed). The dedicated
# security-audit.yml workflow supplies the credentials as repository secrets
# so the audit actually runs there (and drives the README badge); in every
# other context (local runs, the verify/full-check/rhub suites) it skips
# cleanly rather than failing.
